At UnderstandingAI (UAI), our aim is to create a community that provides a safe space for professionals and members of the public to learn about artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence is regarded as one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century [1][2][3][4], and there is a great eagerness to adopt this technology across sectors. As a result, this means that AI, which already touches our lives in many ways, will have an increasing role in our personal and professional lives.

At Understanding AI, we believe everyone from all walks of life deserves a say in the future of AI development and that more should be done to enable the public to understand AI and its broad implications.

Through a range of workshops, panel discussions, presentations and creative activities our community will provide an interface between academia and society such that we can improve the synergy between development and public understanding. We will also use this webpage as an avenue to share interesting articles written by top voices in AI and share learning materials that can slowly build up your understanding of AI.

The organising committee for this community has many years of experience researching AI and considering potential futures provided by technology. We look forward to sharing our experiences with you and learning from your perspectives.
