## The Atomic Human: Understanding Ourselves in the Age of AI

By Neil D. Lawrence

### Descritption:

Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human intelligence. We believe it's what differentiates us. Fears of AI not only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the implied threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our position at the centre of the world.

## The Ethics of A.I.: Facts, Fictions and Forecasts

By Alberto Chierici

## Descritption:

How often have you heard that we must fear an AI-driven apocalypse? That one day the robots will take over? That we will lose our freedoms and follow the leadership of a ruthlessly efficient overlord? This is what we hear on a daily basis, but is there any truth to those claims?

### The AI Mirror: How to Reclaim Our Humanity in an Age of Machine Thinking

by Shannon Vallor

## Descritption:

For many, technology offers hope for the future-that promise of shared human flourishing and liberation that always seems to elude our species. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies spark this hope in a particular way. They promise a future in which human limits and frailties are finally overcome-not by us, but by our machines. Yet rather than open new futures, today's powerful AI technologies reproduce the past. Forged from oceans of our data into immensely powerful but flawed mirrors, they reflect the same errors, biases, and failures of wisdom that we strive to escape. Our new digital mirrors point backward. They show only where the data say that we have already been, never where we might venture together for the first time.

### Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy

by Cathy O'Neil

## Descritption:

We live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives—where we go to school, whether we get a loan, how much we pay for insurance—are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: everyone is judged according to the same rules and bias is eliminated.

And yet, as Cathy O'Neil reveals in this urgent and necessary book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated and incontestable, even when they're wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination.

### AI Ethics (MIT Press Essential Knowledge series)

By Mark Coeckelbergh

## Descritption:

An accessible synthesis of ethical issues raised by artificial intelligence that moves beyond hype and nightmare scenarios to address concrete questions. Artificial intelligence powers Google's search engine, enables Facebook to target advertising, and allows Alexa and Siri to do their jobs. AI is also behind self-driving cars, predictive policing, and autonomous weapons that can kill without human intervention. These and other AI applications raise complex ethical issues that are the subject of ongoing debate.

### AI Snake Oil: What Artificial Intelligence Can Do, What It Can’t, and How to Tell the Difference

By Arvind Narayanan

## Descritption:

Confused about AI and worried about what it means for your future and the future of the world? You’re not alone. AI is everywhere―and few things are surrounded by so much hype, misinformation, and misunderstanding. In AI Snake Oil, computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor cut through the confusion to give you an essential understanding of how AI works and why it often doesn’t, where it might be useful or harmful, and when you should suspect that companies are using AI hype to sell AI snake oil―products that don’t work, and probably never will. -->
